# Welcome to my Thoughts

Hello All. Ever heard of Euler?

The guy was crazy. Way too crazy to realize this perfect-but-scary thing existed.

How beautiful. 
And, now you've realized this site of mine exists. So now you're crazy too. Good. :)

I think my blurbs or thinkings are only sometimes worth reading, and I say this 
genuinely because some nonsense here has no worth to it other then just being bleh coming out of my mouth.
Thank you though for taking a second to read it all - means more to me than you can imagine.
