  <p> I wish my mother was not ruined by those in her life. She is strong, but strong like <br>
    bamboo - breaking with too much tension on a focal point. She tells me not to complain of my <br>
    father, because he is my father - even though he is not the husband she deserves, and nor is <br>
    her own father. She deserves a life where she is not tossed around - by her family, her friends, <br>
    by me. <br> <br>
    I try to understand her. Be her vent to let out dusty air flowing inside her. But she is smarter <br>
    than I. She is too smart because she knows I should not be emotionally burdenned by her pain, <br>
    even though I want to. She cares for me too much to place her burdens on mine as they placed their <br>
    burdens on her. She does not want me to feel an infinite heavyweight, suffocating as the pressure of the <br>
    waves becomes too much to gasp through, as she has felt her whole life. <br> <br>
    She does not want me to drown as she is while on land. <br> <br>
    She smiles when I laugh, even at the jokes she does not understand. She cries at night when her husband <br>
    selfishly cuts her children off from the resources they need to live, but then cries openly when he jokes <br>
    about using those same resources for his own desires. She cannot understand how someone cannot afford to <br>
    buy her groceries that she cooks her children her home-made food with, but can buy himself t-shirts, and <br>
    laud about a new car. <br> <br>
    I know she must think she did something wrong in a past life. I want to hold her, console her - tell her <br>
    that she deserves more, that she has done too much to not. That even if she hadn't done too much, she still <br>
    would deserve more. <br> <br>
    I am sorry to her. For living the life she could not. For having the eternal friend that she lost too early. <br>
    For being able to walk away when she must stay and silently suffer. For laughing at her with him. <br>
    All of which she endures with a smile. <br> <br>
    I am sorry Mama - I am crying as I write this, but I know that that recent day of my birth was the one time I had the <br>
    courage to say this all to you. I don't think I'll be able to again, and I'm not even the one suffering. <br>
    I am sleeping with your jacket right now - I'll take it with me too. The smell of you has faded from it, but <br>
    I can still feel myself in your lap when I close my eyes, petting my hair and kissing my forehead when I pretend <br>
    to be sleeping. <br> <br>
    I love you so much Mama - I hope I can give you a better life soon.

  <p> Its so hard being in such a conflicting relationship with someone you love who is <br>
    also someone who unknowingly brings you down so much. I hate that I ignore them, but <br>
    I know when I talk to them that I don’t know how it will turn out for myself. I know <br>
    they will be fine, but I don’t know if I will be, and it has come to the point where <br>
    taking that risk again is too much. <br> <br>
    I was theirs. Now, I am me, stepping into being theirs when I touch them. Getting old <br>
    seems to only comes with turbulence, and I don’t know how to balance it. My morals and <br>
    my life and my expectations and my pressures and me - its becoming a lot to handle. One <br>
    act of kindness makes me tear up, and I know I don’t even deserve that much. <br><br> … <br><br>
    I give them love now. It has become conditional, but it is there. It has returned and it <br>
    is starting to blossom. But I won’t let it bloom. I have done that before, and it has hurt <br>
    too much to be cut up at such a prime. So, I will enjoy my growing, and hope that they do <br>
    as well. Or, I will hope to be able to ignore their stagnancy.

  <p> The pain he puts her through is not because of who she is. <br>
    Because I put her through pain for who she is. <br>
    But he - he puts her through that pain for who we are, <br>
    and for who we will always be.

  <p> And I wonder, was time, meant to be easy? <br> 
    For I feel the breeze of grief drifting night and day <br> 
    Now I'm swaying and I'm swaying and I am swaying <br>
    and I am waiting and I am fading <br>
    So now I am here - with you, with me <br>
    Can I be let down easily? <br>
    For when I must die, <br>
    I don't want to be alive through it all. <br>
