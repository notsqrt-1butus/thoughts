  <p> Its so hard being in such a conflicting relationship with someone you love who is <br>
    also someone who unknowingly brings you down so much. I hate that I ignore them, but <br>
    I know when I talk to them that I don’t know how it will turn out for myself. I know <br>
    they will be fine, but I don’t know if I will be, and it has come to the point where <br>
    taking that risk again is too much. <br> <br>
    I was theirs. Now, I am me, stepping into being theirs when I touch them. Getting old <br>
    seems to only comes with turbulence, and I don’t know how to balance it. My morals and <br>
    my life and my expectations and my pressures and me - its becoming a lot to handle. One <br>
    act of kindness makes me tear up, and I know I don’t even deserve that much. <br><br> … <br><br>
    I give them love now. It has become conditional, but it is there. It has returned and it <br>
    is starting to blossom. But I won’t let it bloom. I have done that before, and it has hurt <br>
    too much to be cut up at such a prime. So, I will enjoy my growing, and hope that they do <br>
    as well. Or, I will hope to be able to ignore their stagnancy.

  <p> And I wonder, was time, meant to be easy? <br> 
    For I feel the breeze of grief drifting night and day <br> 
    Now I'm swaying and I'm swaying and I am swaying <br>
    and I am waiting and I am fading <br>
    So now I am here - with you, with me <br>
    Can I be let down easily? <br>
    For when I must die, <br>
    I don't want to be alive through it all. <br>
